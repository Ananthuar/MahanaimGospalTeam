ml_notes.txt
------------
This file explains the Malayalam translation JSON (ml.json).

- Purpose: same as en.json but contains Malayalam translations.
- If you refine Malayalam phrasing, update the ml.json file.

- Translator notes:
  * Keep values short when used for buttons or nav items.
  * Ensure special characters (Unicode) are preserved - files must be UTF-8 encoded.
